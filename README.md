# Deep Learning from scratch
Building deep learning library only with Numpy and Matplotlib (for visualization).

## Book 1 (Deep Learning from Scratch 1)
### Book 1 contains basics of Deep Learning
* Perceptron
* Neural Network
* Backpropagation
* Training techniques (Batch Norm, Weight Initialization, Dropout, etc.)
* CNN

## Book 2 (Deep Learning from Scratch 2)
### Book 2 contains Deep Learning on natural language
* word2vec
* Encoder, decoder
* RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
* Gated RNN like LSTM
* Generating text using RNN
* Attention Mechanism
